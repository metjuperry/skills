# Security

**Contract:** roles and privileges are scaffolded locally and `dotnet build`
passes. Local only — nothing deploys; assigning roles to real users happens in a
live environment via the `deploy` skill's profile.

## Ask the CLI first

```
txc workspace component create --help              # every scaffoldable template, by short name
txc component type explain <template>              # what it is, when to use it, and its CHAIN
txc workspace component parameter list <template>  # every parameter, typed, with defaults
txc docs get security-roles                        # long-form guide
```
`txc` prints JSON to stdout and logs to stderr. **Trust the exit code** — an
unknown `--param` fails with *empty stdout* and exit 2 (T20).

## Intent → template

| You want | Template |
|---|---|
| a named set of permissions | `pp-security-role` |
| what a role may do on a table | `pp-security-role-privilege` |
| let a persona open the app | `pp-app-security-role` |

## Sequence

0. **If `implementation-guide.md` has a `Security` section, that is the design** —
   `design:spec` already crossed the personas with the data model. Scaffold it as
   written; don't re-derive who needs what.
1. Roles live in their own solution project (conventionally
   `src/Solutions.Security`).
2. Create the role (**one role file per persona**), then one
   `pp-security-role-privilege` entry per table it touches.
3. Grant the app to each role with `pp-app-security-role` — without it the app
   opens only for system administrators.
4. `txc workspace validate` and `dotnet build`.

## Invariants

- Privilege **levels** are `None` · `User` · `BusinessUnit` · `ParentChild` ·
  `Global` — the platform's values, not the UI's *Basic/Local/Deep* labels, which the
  template rejects. A type left out defaults to `None`. Grant the shallowest that works.
- `PrivilegeTypeAndLevel` takes `[{ "type": "Read", "level": "Global" }, …]` per
  `txc docs get security-roles`; the parameter's own description shows a different,
  stale shape (T23). Follow the doc, and trust the exit code.
- Privileges attach to a role **by name** (`RoleName`), so it must match the role
  file exactly — a typo silently grants nothing.
- Model roles for **personas, not people**; test users get least-privilege roles,
  never admin.
